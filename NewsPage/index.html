            One of Germany's most senior banking regulators has warned London that it is likely to lose its role as "the
            gateway to Europe" for vital financial services.
            Dr Andreas Dombret, executive board member for the German central bank, the Bundesbank, said that even if
            banking rules were "equivalent" between the UK and the rest of the European Union, that was "miles away from
            access to the single market".
